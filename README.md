# Concurrency and Parallelism Report 2018-19 


 I’m expecting the report to have the look and feel of a research paper. In the following list of sections, some are mandatory, others are optional and must be managed with good sense. You may merge two of the proposed sections into a single one, or split on into more sections/subsections and you feel adequate.


### Abstract 

 A very short summary of your work. In these two or three paragraphs you should be able to answer the following questions:

    1. What is the problem?
    2. Why is it interesting/challenging?
    3. What is your approach?
    4. What were the results? What did you learn?

### Introduction 
 
 Extended version of the abstract

### Architecture / Model / Solution 

 Describe your approach/solution in a way that is as inde- pendent as possible form your implementation. What you describe here should be (as much as possible) neutral to the programmin language and to the parallelization framework being used.

### Implementation 

 Showcase for very relevant details in your implementation.

### Experimental evaluation 
 
 How did you make your functional/correctness and performance
evaluation? Were there are relevant results? How do you explain them?
### Conclusions 

 Lessons learned!

### Acknowledgments 

 Please acknowledge the colleagues (external to your group) that directly or indirectly (e.g., on Piazza) helped you during the development of your project.

### References 

 List your sources of information (books, papers, web sites, ...) here, but also be sure you cite them in the main text at least once. This section does not count for the page limit!
###Comments 

 I will appreciate any (constructive — which does not necessarily mean positive) feedback you may think relevant to give about this project. Possible topics include dates and timing, difficulty level, work required, interest, challenging, adequacy, integration into the course schedule (contents of the previous lectures and labs), .... Please feel free to talk about anything you think will help any future edition of this course. This section does not count for the page limit!
